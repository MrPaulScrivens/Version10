The World-Building brand is built for you. If you believe that your greatest work comes from finding joy, then a World-Building Brand fits right in.

Because people are looking to belong to something greater than themselves. 

This happens within a world.

1. Build for yourself
2. Write to yourself
3. Sell to yourself

But doing this isn't easy because what happens when you build a world that nobody wants to join? 

1. Either you aren't doing your best work at the time
2. Or you're doing a poor job of [[Documenting the Journey]]

## Requirements

1. You have to be building something. If you aren't, you become the teacher who has to bust their ass to keep their classes filled.
2. You have to allow people to give you money

## Utilities

A World-Building Brand can not function without money so you have to continue to provide for the world without feeling as though you're removing the joy.

This can be done in two ways:

1. Pay for access to the world (come and watch me build it)
2. Pay for tools used to help build the world

There is a third way, but it often gets in the way of world-building, and that is letting others set up shop in your world (sponsors). These usually come with some caveats that can change how you handle world-building, and it's why they can often feel off to the people in your world.

## Difference Between Utility-Focused Brand

There is a trick with utility-focused brands.

They “cheat”. It's not really cheating but it can feel like cheating.

Some will use engagement pods to boost each other up. Others will use their other accounts to boost them.

Like I said it can feel like cheating but it’s not.
