1. Focus on education. Adopt the mind of your past self, an absolute beginner. How would they get to where you are now in a better way?
2. Focus on understanding. Zoom out and identify the gaps in your follower's knowledge. What do they need to know to get on the same page as you?
3. Focus on importance. Analyze your life and realize why you do what you do. Why do you only have those select skills and beliefs rather than the millions of others you could have? Why did you take the path you did over another one?
