If you can't find joy in the journey, then there is no point because when you're doing what you love, there is no final destination.

It's weird to think there is an end to something that we love. When we love it we don't want it to end.

We are selfish and you need to be selfish about the journey.

## How to Document

- Thoughts
- Inspiration
- Actions
- Epiphanies
- Views / Opinions

You're showing why you do what you do. You're not explaining it, you're showing it. People are smart enough to comprehend when they see it.

It's like telling someone how love feels. 

You need to treat everything like a scrapbook.
