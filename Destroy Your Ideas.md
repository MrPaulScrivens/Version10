To stay on the same path and find success requires luck when you don't allow other opportunities to enter. There could be a better way or your current path could be wrong, but you first must be willing to destroy an idea.

Don't let this cause doubt. Let it breathe excitement into what is possible.

> The ability to destroy your ideas rapidly instead of slowly when the occasion is right is one of the most valueable things. You have to wokr hard on it. Ask yourself what are the garugments on the other side. It's bad to have an opiion you're proud of if you can't state the arguments for the other side better than your opponents. This is a great mental discipline.
