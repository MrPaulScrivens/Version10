How I {desired outcome} in {timeframe} (every {day}):  
  
1. {step you take}  
  
{why you do it}  
{what problem it solves}  
{how the reader can apply themselves}  
  
2. {step you take}  
  
{why you do it}  
{what problem it solves}  
{how the reader can apply themselves}  
  
3. {step you take}  
  
{why you do it}  
{what problem it solves}  
{how the reader can apply themselves}  
etc.  
  
TL;DR:  
  
It takes {required action} to {desired outcome}.  
  
But {doing this thing}, then {doing the next thing}...  
  
Thatâ€™s how you will build {positive side effect}, {positive side effect} and {positive side effect}.
