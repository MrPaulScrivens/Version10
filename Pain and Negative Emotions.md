We remember the thing that brings negative emotions more than anything else.

Because pain is a signal to the brain that tissue is being damaged the first reaction is to always run away from the thing causing the pain. Even if it isn't real.

This is why change can be so difficult.

We feel more pain from losing than gaining. We'd rather avoid losing the thing that we have than gaining something new.

Pain also distorts how we view things. Because we do not like pain we can often take a more favorable view of past events to paint ourselves in a better light. This also plays in to [[Confirmation Bias]].
