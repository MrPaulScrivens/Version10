"...a way of measuring useful effort that is now much more focused on the quality things you produce over time as opposed to the visible activity in the moment." - [[Cal Newport]]

The key part here is the quality of things you produce over time. It's too easy to get caught in the moment and think everything is high stakes today, but if you want to produce a great portfolio of lifetime work then consider what are the few things you can do well now.

This requires focus and focus requires you to do the following:

1. [[Do Fewer Things]]
2. [[Work at a Natural Pace]]
3. [[Obsess Over Quality]]
