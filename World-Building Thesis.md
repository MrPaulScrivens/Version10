A successful business is one that is constantly trying to prove a thesis. 

There is no end proof to the thesis because things are always changing. 

If you don’t know anything then you do things to prove the thesis right or wrong. 

If you’ve shown the thesis works for you show others how it did. 

The thesis drives your direction.
