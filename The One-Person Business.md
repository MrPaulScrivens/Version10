> “We’re going to see 10-person companies with billion-dollar valuations pretty soon…in my little group chat with my tech CEO friends there’s this betting pool for the first year there is a one-person billion-dollar company, which would’ve been unimaginable without AI. And now [it] will happen.”

Most people just want to start something that makes as much as a full-time salary. 

But the concepts between that type of business and the one billion dollar one aren't that different.

There are rules we must play by and rules we think we need to.

There are different plane designs because the design of a plane itself isn't a rule but all designs have to play under the rules of physics.

## The Rule We Have to Play By

The rule of business is simple. 

`Audience x Offer = $$$$$$`

## Rules We Think We Need to Play By

### We think we need a good idea

in 1975, Gary Dahl put a rock in a cardboard box complete with ventilation holes and straw bedding. He sold over one million pet rocks at $4 each.

### We think we need a big audience

In 2019, an Instagrammer with 2.6M followers released some shirts. In theory they should've sold at least 10,000.

She failed to sell 36. The threshold she needed.

### We think we need to know how business works

Remember the rule that we have to play by? If that's the only rule then there is no singular way a business has to work.

The person with dreams of starting a fancy restaurant might not get why the food truck that sells everything is so successful.

## What Do We Need?

`Audience x Offer = $$$$$$`

1. Social media agency
2. Affiliate marketing
3. Digital products
4. Boring businesses
5. Influencers

People want to be told exactly what to do until they realize they can't excel following someone else's plans.

### Two Types of Businesses

1. Methodical. Car washes, vending machines, laundromats.
2. Curious.

I can't help with the methodical business and to be honest you don't need much help.

It's the Curious business that fascinates me. This is the one people want to start and then fail miserably at because they just don't get it.

They want to believe that their feelings about the thing are automatically put onto their audience. When that doesn't happen they tell themselves business isn't meant for them.

But when we look at the one rule we have to play by we forget something about the audience. 

They want to be interested in the thing just as much as we are but they need a reason. 

- Hooks
- Structure
- Storytelling

What happens when everyone knows these things? What happens when everyone has their own business?

It's not enough to be passionate. Passionate or curious are the starting points.

That's what gets people interested. What keeps their attention is the payoff. Did they walk away from your interaction feeling better?

Attention is the light. Money is the oxygen.

## So What Then?

It's easy to fall into a trap of trying to figure out what they want. I think the most successful people are going to be those who pursue what they want and are really good at documenting how they get it.

Do that consistently, and you'll win.
